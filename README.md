===========================
Fifth Column - Source Files
===========================

This is the source code of an early Pre-Alpha version (0.0.5.2.)
which was earlier on released without source code on indiedb.com.

Small changes have been made for legal purposes. The assets are
mostly raw and this is intended for those interested how FifthColumn
works.

Unfortunately, there are no commits earlier than version 0.0.5.2. as
the current source data was taken from a backup stored outside a repository. 
One reason this repository was created to prevent the assets and code of Fifth Column
going lost, as there isn't active development as of september 19 2016.

1. Download the code and extract it into, or do a source control checkout on,
an empty folder on your computer like C:\Choose\Your\Path\FifthColumn
2. Install Unreal Engine 4.9
3. Download the archive containing Fifth Column's assets. These files can be found on 
http://37.97.222.130/fifthcolumn_assets_0052.tar.gz 
Extract the folder named content into "C:\Choose\Your\Path\FifthColumn"
4. Make sure you have a compiler ready to handle C++ code. For Windows
Visual Studio 2013 is recommended.
5. Click FifthColumn.uproject to launch

Any problems or suggestions can be mailed to

Enjoy!
