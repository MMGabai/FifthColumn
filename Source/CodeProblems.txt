Current code smells that may need attention

Lazy Classes:
* Book (deleted - done, functionality moved to ActivatableObject)
* Poster (deleted - done, functionality moved to ActivatableObject)
* FCPlayerController (expand - done)
Duplicates:
* FCWeapon & ActivatableObject have many common methods
 - Solution: Create FCItem as common parent class (done)
