Current code smells that may need attention

Lazy Classes:
* Book (deleted - done, functionality moved to ActivatableObject, class abolished)
* Poster (deleted - done, functionality moved to ActivatableObject, class abolished)
* FCPlayerController (move all functionality to FCPlayerCharacter, then abolish this class)
* FCInventoryItem (move all functionality to AFCWeapon, then abolish this class)
* FCHUD (move all functionality to AFCPlayerCharacter, then abolish this class)
* DisturbanceSource (built-in Noise emitter should do the trick)
Blueprint hell:
* Make sure Widget variables are readily available from the C++ code
* Abolish the Knightley blueprint, place all functionality in player character
Duplicates:
* FCWeapon & ActivatableObject have many common methods
 - Solution: Create FCItem as common parent class (done)
