Known issues
 * Weapons occasionally fall through the ground
 * No weapon is equipped after a weapon pickup, though changing weapons fixes this [fixed]
 * Quests can be completed before they are started
 * Dialogues cannot be opened when opened before - this seems to be introduced by a recent change [fixed]
 * Reload animations do not play if performed too soon after another one - maybe introduce a delay?
 * Simulate always crashes [fixed]
 * Switching weapons using the mouse wheel while crouched causes the player to uncrouch  [fixed]
 * The Brownings Hi-Power's muzzle flash may continue
